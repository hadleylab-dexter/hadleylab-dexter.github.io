# IDFs — CANON

inherits: /DEXTER/

---

## Axiom

**IDFs = LEARNING output. Machine-generated invention disclosures.**

---

## Structure

IDFs are emitted by EVO when novel patterns are detected:

```
EVO detects pattern → validates novelty → generates IDF → human review
```

---

## Constraints

1. IDFs MUST be generated by LEARNING (not human-authored).
2. IDFs MUST cite evidence from DOMAINS.
3. IDFs MUST be reviewed by human before GOLD status.
4. IDFs MUST link to source data/patterns.

## Evidence

| Claim | Authority | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Machine-generated | GOLD | EVO logs |
| Novel patterns | SILVER | DOMAINS |

*IDFs | LEARNING | DEXTER*
