# CV — CANON

inherits: /DEXTER/

---

## Axiom

**CV = Living LEDGER. Authority that enables WRITING. Fluid discovery.**

Traditional CVs are static. CANONIC CV enables:
- Fluid discovery through LEDGER
- Full student tracking
- EVO learns from commits
- Gaps bootstrap automatically

---

## Formula

```
CV = VITAE + STUDENTS + GRANTS + PAPERS + DISCOVERY
```

## Structure

## STUDENTS Tracking

| Role | Count | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Predoctoral | 34+ | tracked |
| Post-doctoral | 10+ | tracked |
| Residents | 5+ | tracked |
| Alumni | 20+ | graduated |

## DISCOVERY

Fluid discovery captures:
- **Insights** — from CHAT sessions
- **Patterns** — from LEDGER analysis
- **Predictions** — from EVO learning
- **Gaps** — bootstrapped from history

---

## Constraints

1. CV MUST establish authority.
2. CV MUST track students.
3. CV MUST log grants.
4. CV MUST enable fluid discovery.
5. All claims MUST trace to evidence.
6. EVO MUST learn from CV commits.
