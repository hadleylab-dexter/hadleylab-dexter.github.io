## LEARNING Contribution

DEXTER content trains:
- **MAMMOCHAT** — clinical trials matching
- **EVO** — bootstraps gaps, predicts additions
- **CHAT** — context, responses

---

## Constraints

1. CV MUST establish authority before PAPER or BOOK.
2. PAPERS MUST cite evidence from DOMAINS.
3. BOOKS MUST reference PAPERS.
4. All content MUST be tracked in LEDGER.
5. All content MUST flow to SHOP.
6. All content MUST train LEARNING.
